🍰🧁 THE BAKERY 🧁🍰

This project is an educational project
The project was done over a period of time during my studies
The project contains a server side - which is where it focuses mainly
And a client side - mainly for fun 😉
The project has a base for database 
But for now it only contains a json file
The project contains a bakery
The bakery has different cakes, managers and customers.
A manager can manage customers, add and remove,
And change their details.
The manager can also add and remove cakes sold by the bakery.
There can be multiple managers.
Only a manager can delete a customer or add and remove a cake.

A customer will see a list of cakes
He can buy cakes and thus see his list of cakes

The data is saved and is not deleted even when the software is closed
